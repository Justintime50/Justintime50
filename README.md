## Technical Founder @ [Golf Rocket](https://github.com/golf-rocket) | Senior Software Engineer

I love all things tech. I've been programming for 20+ years, tinkering with electronics for 15+ years, and founding or building tech companies for 10+ years. I'm an open source fanatic, Apple fanboy, and love to explore new tech. I spend my time coding open source projects, tinkering with electronics and new tech products, and consulting teams on how to get things done.
